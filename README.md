## Title of the talk
The Era of Module Bundlers.

## Summary
This talk will walk everyone through the concept and practical usage of JavaScript module bundling and optimisation. With the emergence of advanced bundling tools like Webpack, the JavaScript ecosystem has been enriched with the right set of processes and tools required for creating production-ready builds, which is what this talk aims at covering.  
This talk will also cover essential differences between task runners and bundlers with focus on advanced optimisation techniques like Tree shaking and Code splitting.
